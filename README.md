#Scott Southard
Building with passion. Consistently tinkering.
Discovering and delighting in things that are simple, functional, and meaningful.
Constantly trying to improve myself as a developer and as a human being.  

This site is meant as a simple conduit for my efforts and projects. Nothing too fancy (mostly just a lovely Bootstrap theme with some tweaks), but much nicer looking than the previous iteration, I assure you.
