<!--How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?<br>
It was a task that seemed daunting and unworkable at first, but as soon as we paired up and began airing our concerns and the potentital solutions, it ended up helping a lot. I learned a lot from my pair, and it improved my wireframe immensely <br>
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?<br>
I did. It was a nice framework to work from, so instead of conceptually writing a bunch of HTML, I could almost just translate what was already wireframed into HTML. Obviously, there will be more to it than that, but from the standpoint of getting a basic template of HTML down, wireframing helped a ton. <br>
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? <br>
One thing we both were pretty adament about was that it was important to have navigational aspects. The user needs to be able to move around any page with relative ease, and to get back to the start if they need to. It obviously also included a header for a title, subheader for more specificity, body for text, an image or two, and some contact links. <br> 
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)? <br>
I didn't learn any specifically new elements, but I did get a very solid workout working with links. The placement and structure of a link in HTML is confusing at first, but after going through this, makes complete sense! -->
