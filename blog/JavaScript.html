      <p>Iteration (Or A Lack Thereof) in JavaScript</p>
    </div>
    <div class="maintext">
      <article>One of the most helpful, efficient, and effective aspects of Ruby as a language is its ability to iterate. Using methods like <code>each</code> and <code>map</code> to work through every element of a collection is hugely helpful and timesaving (both in a code-based, DRY sense as well as computationally). However, this is not the way of all languages, and in turn, there are other options for "iterating" in these languages. Today, I want to look at JavaScript's compensatory use of loops.<br><br>
      Ruby's use of <code>each</code> was a bit of shorthand for a counter, a while statement, and a counter increase: <br>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/scottsouthard/72486a0d01dc70f40037.js"></script><br>
      
      This is all fine and good, but JavaScript just plops us in quite literally with a quick and easy way to define that loop.<br>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/scottsouthard/5e3d32683dbbb2b12a76.js"></script><br>
      If you look carefully, you'll notice the three statements within the for loop's parenthesis. Each statement performs one of the actions that the much longer code in Ruby was performing. The first sets the starting point of the loop, the second sets the ending point, and the third sets the increments for increasing the counter. All of these add up to a much simpler, cleaner version of a loop (and a mighty fine alternative to iterators as well!).
