        Version control is an incredibly important aspect of coding, and any other technically creative endeavor. Since coding relies so heavily upon minute details and many small working parts, it necessitates a lot of tweaking and small additions and subtractions. Version control allows us to look at different save states of a given file and make small, incremental changes and then see the result. Without condensing changes into small groups, we'd either be left with a log of every single change (which would be overwhelming!) or no way to go back at all (which would be impossible). 
      <br>
        Git helps the user keep track of these changes with a system of commits. Each commit is a save point where the latest grouping of changes is clumped together in a (hopefully) organized and well labelled manner. 
      <br>
        GitHub is a great tool for version control and git. It offers a couple of useful features. The first is remote storage for all of your code. That means you can save it locally, as well as remotely, just in case something happens to your computer (lord knows it will). The second is a bit less simple, but just as helpful. GitHub acts as a centralized hub for multiple collaborators on any given file. That means you and I and all of our friends can simultaneously work on a project and submit our changes to a central file location. This way, we don't jumble it up or walk over each others' code, and we have an organized series of branches that we can keep clean and progressive.
