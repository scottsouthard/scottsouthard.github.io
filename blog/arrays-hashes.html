    <p>Arrays and Hashes</p>
    </div>
    <div class="maintext">
      <article>   When we begin to look at some of the collection groups in Ruby, the two heavy hitters look very much alike, yet very different in a few "key" (see what I did there?) regards. But before we start cross examining the two, let's take a look at each collection on it's own merit. <br>
        <br>
        <b>ARRAYS</b>
        <br>
        Arrays are an ordered collection of objects. Simple, right? Well, actually, yeah.  <br>
        Here's an easy one: <br>
        <code>array = [1, 2, 3, 4] </code> <br>
        Each of our objects (1, 2, 3, and 4) are laid out in a specific order. Later, when we look to manipulate this array, we can access any of the four objects by calling it's position within the array.
        <br>
        <b>HASHES</b> <br>
        Hashes are also collections of objects, but they're a little more complicated. Rather than having a built-in position system, like arrays, hashes let you assign your own key to each object. And that's exactly what it's called: a key! <br>Let's take a look at a simple hash:<br>
        <code>hash = {one: 1, two: 2, three: 3, four: 4}</code><br>
        As you can see, hashes are a little bit different, but realistically, a similar process is going on. Instead of having a default system of assigning a position to each object, hashes require you to name a key that's associated with each object (in which the object becomes the key's "value"). This allows for a bit more pointed and less arbitrary association between objects. <br>
        <br>
        In practice, both arrays and hashes can be used for a lot of the same things, but there are some instances where one performs far better than the other. If the data you're looking at is a simple list of singular objects, it's generally fine to use an array. It's a simpler class that requires a bit less fine tuning. However, if the objects in question are associated or tied to separate entities, a hash might be a better tool, in order to keep the objects and their associations in order (using keys and values!).
