        When I began building this site from scratch, it was about as low brow as a site could be. White background, black text (16px, through and through), and absolutely no formatting.
        After spending more time on the project and learning a ton in DBC, I transformed it into something that is much more fully realized and put together (if still a little rough around the edges).
        <br><br>
        Some of the most enjoyable time I've spent has been fiddling with the details. Moving things based on single pixels and percentage points to get it just right is invigorating, and the time spent
        on those details flies by with startling rapidity. 
        <br><br>
        In a similar vein, however, it's been tough to know when to keep diving down the rabbit holes and when to scrap an idea and start from scratch. I've become attached to each header and div, and cringe at the thought of removing their formatting
        and starting over. But it's happened and will continue to happen, because sometimes that's the most effective course of action.  It's been a tough lesson, but a very important one.
        <br><br>
        Overall, putting this little site together from nothing has been a monumental exercise in learning. I've gained so much knowledge with every step of the process, from HTML to CSS to JavaScript, the bits of information
        that have been necessary to absorb have flooded my system, and at this point, I don't think they'll ever leave.
