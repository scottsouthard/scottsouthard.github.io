      <article>Ruby has been one of the most important, transformative languages of the last 20 years, and as such has gained loads of popularity and outside support. This has lead to innovations that have made the language, and its implementation, much more efficient and effective.<br><br>

      Ruby on Rails, or Rails for short, is an extension of Ruby. More accurately, it is an expansion using the RubyGems package management system, that provides a more robust and streamlined version of Ruby. <br><br>
      To be clear, Ruby on Rails has it's own shorthand and is not simply more Ruby, but it does use the syntax and much of the diction of Ruby, and could be seen as an extra layer added to Ruby's original structure.<br><br>
      The main use and benefit of Rails is its implementation of tools that streamline mundane, average tasks. There are pre-built models that frame some of the basic structures we see on the web. It is meant to make development simpler, placing a heavy emphasis on the concept of DRY and allowing Convention over Configuration to be one of it's overriding principles. 
      The idea is to have a foundation for development that requires less code and more functionality. <br><br>
      What we end up with is a standardized language that promotes simplicity and efficiency, both in code and in the coding required. When combined with the standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Ruby on Rails can be a powerful tool for providing dynamic websites or applications that take web development to the next level.
